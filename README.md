# Regulatory Compliance Ontology for Anti-Money Laundering Regulations: AML-RCO.

The Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Regulatory Compliance Ontology (RCO) is founded on the formal representation of financial domain behaviours and the AML regulationâ€™s provisions for addressing Regulatory Compliance Monitoring (RCM), which directly supports Regulatory Compliance Reporting in the Asset Management and Investment Funds (AMIF) domain. The AML-RCO ontology comprises a domain ontology, AMIF-Banking, and an operational ontology, AMIF Suspicious Transaction Detection. 
AMIF-Banking ontology is based on FIBO [1]. FIBO is also based on upper ontologies, such as SKOS [2] and Country Representation [3]. The FIBO modules that were included in AMIF-Banking are FIBO-Core, FND (Foundations), IND (Indices and Indicators) and FBC (Financial Business and Commerce.
The AMIF-Banking ontology helps analyse transaction activity behaviours with reference to specific regulatory provisions (e.g. obligations, prohibitions, exemptions with thresholds and restrictions). The ontology provides declarative logical axioms that help determine if those behaviours are suspicious and if they breach regulatory provisions. The ontology, therefore, encodes relevant concepts from the financial domain and the behaviours identified in a set of competency questions, which drive AML-RCO, to differentiate between normal and suspicious activities, according to the regulatory provisions set out in the European Directives 2005/60 [4], 2005/70 [5] and 2015/849 [6].
