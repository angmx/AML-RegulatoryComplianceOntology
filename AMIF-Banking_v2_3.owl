    <owl:Ontology rdf:about="http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/2020/AMIF-Banking">
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines a set of basic concepts for lifecycles, including the various stages and events that make up a given lifecycle, for use in describing product, trade, instrument, production, and other lifecycles in FIBO.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines a set of general purpose relations for use in other FIBO ontology elements.  These include a number of properties required for reuse across the foundations and business entities models.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines abstract concepts for representation documents for use in other FIBO ontology elements.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines abstract concepts for representation of classification schemes that themselves are intended to permit the classification of arbitrary concepts into hierarchies (or partial orders) for use in other FIBO ontology elements.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines abstract concepts for representation of identifiers, identification schemes, indices and indexing schemes for use in other FIBO ontology elements.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines abstract structural concepts, including arrangement and collection, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These abstract concepts are further refined to support definition of identifiers, codes, quantities, and schemata that organize and classify such identifiers and codes.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines basic concepts such as payment, payee, payer, and payment schedule, extending the scheduling concepts from the Dates and Times module, among others.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines basic financial service providers, such as holding companies, financial institutions (both depository and non-depository institutions), and clearing houses at a relatively general level. Nuances specific to the institutions located in a specific country are defined in jurisdiction specific dependent ontologies.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines concepts around contractually capable business entities. The terms defined here are those which are relevant to the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) work. The term known as legal entity in that work is identified as a formal organization which is recognized in some jurisdiction as being capable of incurring some liability, whether or not is a legal person as understood by the legal community. This is labeled as contractually capable entity, to avoid confusion with the accepted legal term for Legal Entity. Such entities are recognized as requiring an LEI, but the identifier itself is allocated to the formal organization which is recognized as being contractually capable.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines concepts for agreements, for use in other ontology elements. Agreements as defined here are the actual agreements between parties, and this ontology is intended to be referred to in conjunction with the contracts ontology which defines the actual contracts which formalize such agreements. The concepts of agreement and contract are intended to be kept distinct in the FIBO ontologies, that is neither is intended to be regarded as a sub type of the other.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines concepts for people and human related terms, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. People as defined here are human persons only. This ontology sets out a number of basic properties which are held by people or are definitive of a small number of specific types of people such as minors or adults. Primary use cases for determining the set of personal information definitions included are the common elements required to (1) open a bank account, (2) identify a sophisticated investor, and (3) establish foreign account ownership for money laundering purposes.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines concepts for representation of registration authorities, registrars, registration-specific identifiers and related identification schemes, and registration authorities specific to ISO and the financial industry.  Examples of financial industry registration authorities in the US include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC).</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines concepts relating to contracts, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These include written contracts which are the concrete evidence of agreements between parties, along with verbal contracts. Contracts are further broken down into bilateral and transferable contracts, the latter being the basis for most financial instruments. Properties of contracts are also defined, in particular contractual terms and contract parties. These concepts all form the basis of concepts in the financial services industry, for example interest payment terms are a kind of contract terms set, and security holders are a kind of contract counterparty.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines concepts relating to corporation-specific control. These concepts are based on the general types of control (both de facto control and controlling interests), as defined in the ControlParties ontology, and are the specific examples of these concepts as they apply to companies incorporated by the issuance of shares.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines concepts relating to corporation-specific ownership. Roles are defined in terms of the ownership enjoyed by the party, and are the specific examples of these concepts as they apply to companies incorporated by the issuance of shares.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines concepts relating to executives and their formal capacities. The concepts defined in this ontology cover types of corporate officers, board members and the like, along with the capacities in terms of which those party roles are defined, and the kinds of entity (principally natural persons) that are able to perform in those roles.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines concepts relating to types of controlling parties. The concepts defined here are party in role concepts, which define the nature of some entity such as an organization or a legal person, in some role such as that of owning a controlling interest in the entity or of controlling that entity. These roles are defined in terms of the types of control enjoyed by the party, for example de facto or de jure control. An important feature of this ontology is the distinction between the holding of a controlling interest (such as voting shares), and the de facto existence of control of one body by another as asserted in company filings or as a conclusion drawn from computational analysis of controlling interests.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines concepts relating to types of organization owning parties. The concepts defined here are party in role concepts, which define the nature of some entity such as an organization or a legal person, in some role such as that of owning equity in the entity. These roles are defined in terms of the ownership enjoyed by the party, with distinctions between constitutional ownership i.e. ownership defined in terms of stockholder equity, and investment ownership more generally.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines concepts that are common to all debt instruments, such as debt, borrower, lender, debtor, creditor, interest, principal, and the like. It is designed to be used by various other FIBO specifications, including but not limited to SEC/Debt and LOAN.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines concepts that extend the Foundations (FND) Products and Services concepts specifically for the financial industry, including financial product, financial service, and financial service provider.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines currency and monetary amount related concepts for use in defining other FIBO ontology elements. There are two distinct kinds of concepts that correspond to money and amounts: a concrete, actual amount of money, and the monetary measure of something denominated in some currency. These are dimensionally the same but whereas &apos;money amount&apos; is defined as an amount of money, &apos;monetary amount&apos; is an abstract monetary measure.

The definition of currency provided herein is compliant with the definitions given in ISO 4217.  ISO 4217 provides universally applicable coded representations of names of currencies and funds, used internationally for financial transaction support.  The ontology has been partitioned into 2 parts: (1) the essential concept system describing the standard (this module), and (2) ISO4217-1-CurrencyCodes, which contains all of the individuals specified in ISO 4217.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines equity-related concepts for use in defining other FIBO ontology elements. These are based on basic accounting principles as they relate to equity, debt, assets and liabilities of a firm. Equity forms the basis for ownership of certain forms of corporate body.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines formal business organizations and related concepts. The ontology covers parts of organizations, membership, classification, address relations and other properties which are applicable to formal business organizations generally. The concept of a formal business organization forms the basis for articulation of types of organization, both incorporated and non-incorporated, in other FIBO-BE ontologies.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines fundamental concepts for buyers, sellers, clients, customers, products, goods and services for use in other FIBO ontologies.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines general purpose concepts for representation of regulatory agencies, also known as regulatory authorities or regulators.  Examples of financial industry regulatory agencies in the US include the Securities Exchange Commission, FINRA, and the FDIC, among others.  The SEC and FINRA are both registration authorities and regulatory agencies.  The FDIC is a regulatory agency and an insurer, and may be a registration authority for certain state-chartered banks in the US without bank holding companies.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines high level concepts relating to jurisdictions for use in other FIBO ontology elements. This includes a general definition of jurisdiction along with some basic types of jurisdiction, along with the factors which distinguish one type of jurisdiction from another. This ontology also defines basic types of legal system, and extends the basic concept of law which is in the LegalCore ontology..</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines high-level concepts for organizations and related terms, for use in other FIBO ontology elements.  It is purposefully underspecified to facilitate mapping to specific organization ontologies, such as the emerging W3C organization ontology, organization from a BMM or BPMN perspective, organization from a records management (RMS) perspective, and so forth.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines high-level legal concepts for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These concepts include law and constitution, both of which are framed at a more abstract level than national or state laws and constitutions, so that law forms the basis both for statutes and for company by-laws, and constitution forms the basis both for national or state constitutions and for instruments which are constitutive of incorporated legal entities. This ontology also defines some of the variants of these such as governmental constitutions and ordinances. Other types of law are provided in the Jurisdictions ontology as extensions of concepts in this ontology. Court of Law is also defined here.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines high-level legal concepts, especially those related to legal responsibilities, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. The ontology defines things which are conferred upon some entity by some legal instrument, and elaborates this into a number of specific capacities, responsibilities and powers, each of which forms the basis for many of the concepts used elsewhere in FIBO in defining legal personhood, executive powers and the like.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines high-level, control-related concepts for use in other FIBO ontology elements.  The ontology covers basic concepts around control, along with a distinction between de jure and de facto control, the former being derived with reference to terms in the LegalCapacity ontology.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines high-level, ownership-related concepts for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These include the concept of owner, asset and ownership along with relationships between them whereby an asset is some thing owned by some owner.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines legal personhood concepts. A legal person as defined here is any natural person or organization which is capable of accruing liability on its own part.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines some high-level concepts of roles for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These concepts include the basic property whereby something has some role, along with the high-level concept of an agent in a role. The agent in role concept provides the basis for party in role concepts in the PartyRoles ontology and is framed as some entity defined specifically in respect to some role which it performs in some context..</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines the basic mechanisms that establish legal personhood for judicial or artificial persons, specifically those that are corporate bodies, including bodies incorporated by equity, by guarantee, and by agreement.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines the concept of a goal, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. Goal is defined in general terms and forms one of the basic properties of organizations.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines the concept of an objective, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. Objectives are defined as being distinct from goals, in that they constitute time limited and measurable targets which some entity may seek to attain in pursuit  of its goals.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines the concept of autonomous agent for use in other FIBO ontology elements. As defined here, autonomous agent corresponds to what is often referred to as &quot;agent&quot; in software and other systems. It is defined as any entity which is able to act on its own part, and embraces all such things, including people, animals, software agents organizations and all forms of legal persons, although not all of these concepts are elaborated in FIBO as not all are relevant to financial services.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines the fundamental concepts for companies incorporated by the issuance of shares. Terms defined in this ontology are those which are applicable to all such entities. Many of these concepts form the basis of the relationships of ownership and control which obtain between entities of this type.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines the fundamental concepts for entities defined by their function, such as the relationship to the various forms which one or another functionally-defined entity may take. It also includes a number of basic types of entity defined by function, such as business and non-profit. The concepts in this ontology are intended to be extensible in other ontologies which may be dedicated to specific kinds of functionally-defined business entity or organization.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines the fundamental concepts for markets, exchanges, regulated markets, and multilateral trading facilities for use in the development of downstream FIBO domain ontologies that require them.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines the fundamental concepts for publishers of information, including entities whose primary function is to publish, and entities (whether or not they are publishers in that sense) which are in the role of the publisher of some information. This ontology also includes the published information itself, i.e. the publication.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines the fundamental concepts for representing polities and government entities and their relations.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines the fundamental concepts relevant to financial instruments in general, with the intent of providing the high-level hooks for build-out in more detail in the relevant domain areas.  These include, but are not limited to, equities, options, debt instruments, and so forth, some of which may be negotiable.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines the high level concept of formal organization for use in other FIBO ontology elements.  It is purposefully underspecified to facilitate mapping to other formal organization ontologies, such as the emerging W3C formal organization ontology, or others defined for specific business and financial services standards. The concepts in this ontology extend those in the Organizations ontology.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines the high-level concepts of parties in roles, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. The concept of a party in a role describes some entity defined specifically in terms of some role which it performs in some formal contractual or transactional relationship. The ontology includes one or more basic party in role concepts. The ontology also includes one or more logical combinations of types of autonomous entity which may perform some of the party roles defined elsewhere in this ontology, such as the role of ownership.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology defines the notion of a Report and related party concepts.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology extends definitions of date and schedule concepts from the FinancialDates ontology with concepts defining dates that may be adjusted when they fall on weekends or holidays as defined in a given business center, for use in other FIBO ontologies.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology extends definitions of date and schedule concepts from the FinancialDates ontology with concepts defining occurrences (i.e., event-related concepts) for use in other FIBO ontologies.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology extends the Registration Authorities ontology to define specific kinds of registries, such as business entity registries, registries for identifiers and codes of various sorts, and registries for financial institutions and intermediaries based on jurisdiction, who regulates them, and the services they provide.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology provides a very high level definition of geographic region and geopolitical entity related concepts, including, but not limited to, countries, sub-country regions such as states and provinces, municipalities, etc., extending the Object Management Group (OMG)&apos;s Languages, Countries, and Codes (LCC) ontologies as needed in FIBO. As such, these terms are automatically mapped to the LCC controlled vocabulary representing ISO 3166 country and country subdivision codes, and may be mapped to other de facto standards such as Geonames and the CIA World Factbook.  The concept of a business center, defined herein, maps directly to the FpML concept with the same name, and to the set of business centers and broader municipalities included in ISO 10383, Codes for exchanges and market identification (MIC).</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology provides an initial set of concepts supporting the representation of quantities, units, systems of quantities, and systems of units for use in FIBO. It is compatible with and can be mapped directly to the OMG Date Time Vocabulary (DTV) Quantities Ontology, but has been integrated into FND to provide local coverage of quantities and measurements and eliminate the SBVR mark-up.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology provides basic concepts such as account, account holder, account provider, relationship manager that are commonly used by financial services providers to describe customers and to determine counterparty identities.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology provides definitions of date and schedule concepts for use in other FIBO ontologies.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology provides high level definitions for addresses and address components for use in other FIBO ontology elements.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology provides mathematical abstractions for use in other ontologies, including for example the basic components of formulae, parameters and values.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology provides scaffolding for use in describing concepts related to facilities, both virtual and physical, including physical sites that provide various facilities.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This ontology provides scaffolding for use in describing virtual location-oriented concepts.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract>This vocabulary provides a set of metadata annotations for use in describing FIBO ontology elements.  The annotations extend properties defined in the OMG&apos;s Specification Metadata Recommendation, in the Dublin Core Metadata Terms Vocabulary and in the W3C Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) Vocabulary, and have been customized to suit the FIBO specification development process.  

Note that any of the original properties provided in Dublin Core and SKOS can be used in addition to the terms provided herein.  However, any Dublin Core terms that are not explicitly defined as OWL annotation properties in this ontology or in any of its imports must be so declared in the ontologies that use them.</terms:abstract>

        <SpecificationMetadata:fileAbstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The purpose of the Country Representation ontology, based on ISO 3166 and other representations of geographic regions and countries, such as the ISO Online Browsing Platform, UN M49 Region codes, SWIFT registry, UN FAO and CIA World Factbook, FIPA and International Olympics codes for countries, and GeoNames, is to provide a systematic description of the vocabulary used for country and geopolitical entity representation (based strictly on requirements for business applications, not broader geographic or political uses). A few additional properties to support geophysical coordinates, identified in the UN FAO and CIA World Factbook as well as from the well-known GeoNames ontology, have been added, but extensions to support other coding systems, such as the FAOSTAT code, have not been included.

ISO 3166 provides widely, though not universally, applicable coded representations of names of countries, dependencies, and other areas of particular geopolitical interest and their subdivisions.
 - ISO 3166-1 (Country codes) establishes codes that represent the current names of countries, dependencies, and other areas of particular geopolitical interest, on the basis of lists of country names obtained from the United Nations.
 - ISO 3166-2 (Country subdivision code) establishes a code that represents the names of the principal administrative divisions, or similar areas, of the countries, etc. included in the ISO 3166-1.
 - ISO 3166-3 (Code for formerly used names of countries) establishes a code that represents non-current country names, i.e., the country names deleted from ISO 3166 since its first publication in 1974.
 
The United Nations Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use (M49), described at https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/, provides further regional classification for countries by continent, region within a continent, and sub-regions within regions that are widely used as well, and so this ontology is designed to support the M49 code set as well.  M49 reuses the ISO 3166 codes for countries and some regions, and augments that with additional, broader regional codes.

This ontology provides a reference model to support the first two parts of ISO 3166, along with the other coding systems mentioned above.</SpecificationMetadata:fileAbstract>
        <SpecificationMetadata:fileAbstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This ontology, based on ISO 639 as well as the language element of the Language Tag specified in BCP 47 (RFC 4646, RFC 4647), provides a systemic description of the vocabulary used for language representation, including natural and artificial languages. 

ISO 639 provides two language codes, one as a two-letter code (ISO 639-1) and another as a three-letter code (ISO 639-2, ISO 639-3, ISO 639-5) for the representation of names of languages.  ISO 639-1 was devised primarily for use in terminology, lexicography, and linguistics.  ISO 639-2 represents all of the languages contained in ISO 639-1, additional languages and language groups, as they may be coded for special purposes when more specificity in coding is needed.  The languages listed in ISO 639-1 are a subset of the languages listed in ISO 639-2; every language code element in the two-letter code has a corresponding language code element in the three-letter code, but not necessarily vice versa.  ISO 639-4 provides the basis for describing languages, as defined in this ontology, and additional codes are provided in 639-5 and other parts of the standard, again with more details about macrolanguages, other lesser known independent languages, and special language groups.

ISO 639-3 extends the set of three-letter codes provided in 639-2 to cover all of the natural, human languages in use today, along with many well-known ancient, extinct, and historical languages, including written and signed languages.  It also identifies the codes found in 639-2 that represent families or groups of languages rather than a single human language, depending on the perspective of the consumer.

The Registration Authority for ISO 639-1 is the International Information Centre for Terminology, ISO 639-1/RA.  This organization is responsible for maintenance of Part-1, and more information can be found at http://www.infoterm.info/standardization/iso_639_1_2002.php, although the actual code set is maintained by the US Library of Congress, together with the code set for ISO 639-2.

The Registration Authority for ISO 639-2 is the Library of Congress, ISO 639-2/RA.  The Library of Congress is responsible for maintenance of Part-2, at http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/iso639-2ra.html.  Current code sets for ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2 are available from this site, as mentioned above.  In addition to the material covered in the basic standard, the Library of Congress also publishes the German names for all languages, which is reflected in the properties given below.  See http://loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php for the latest release.

The Registration Authority for ISO 639-3 is SIL International, ISO 639-3/RA.  SIL International is responsible for maintenance of Part-3, and more information can be found at http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/default.asp.

The codes included herein also correspond to the language element of the Language Tag specified in BCP 47 (RFC 4646, RFC 4647), and can be used for matching or other application development purposes (e.g., use of language identifier literals in applications that build up the RFC 4646 based tags).

This ontology (Language Representation) defines the model for the standard, based in part on ISO 639-4, with individual codes for the other parts of the standard represented in dependent models.</SpecificationMetadata:fileAbstract>

        <SpecificationMetadata:specificationAbstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This ontology provides a set of basic metadata annotations for use in describing Object Management Group (OMG) specifications, standards, and documents.  It was recommended for use by the OMG Architecture Board (AB) in OMG standard ontologies, vocabularies and other models at the March 2013 Reston meeting. 

The annotations defined herein extend properties defined in the Dublin Core Metadata Terms Vocabulary and in the W3C Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) Vocabulary, and have been customized to support the OMG specification development process.  Note that any of the original properties provided in Dublin Core and SKOS can be used in addition to the terms provided herein.  However, any Dublin Core terms that are not explicitly defined as OWL annotation properties below must be so declared in the ontologies that use them.</SpecificationMetadata:specificationAbstract>

This includes generalizing the ontology to accommodate country and region coding systems in addition to the ISO 3166 codes, providing some flexibility to use this ontology as the schema to support integration and use of other systems.  Such coding systems might include governmental and corporate distinctions from the codes published by the U.N. and standardized by ISO, or reflect domain-specific codes such as the International Olympic Committee, International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), or other international or national sporting organizations. The structure of the ontologies representing the codes themselves has been revised to support an ontology per country for the subdivision codes, so that users can leverage only those they need rather than having to load close to five thousand individuals for applications requiring a small subset of that number. Generation of the country and subdivision ontologies is entirely automated to facilitate change management going forward.</skos:changeNote>

        <skos:changeNote>This ontology was added to Foundations in advance of the December 2014 Long Beach meeting in support of the SEC specification.  It is also needed to provide temporal relationships for Ownership and Control.

These three ontologies are designed for use together:

   * FinancialDates  -- financial Dates and Schedules
   * BusinessDates -- business day adjustments
   * Occurrences    -- occurrences (events) and kinds of occurrences

They are modularized this way to minimize the ontological committments that are imposed upon ontologies that rely upon them.  Ontologies can import FinancialDates alone, or FinancialDates + BusinessDates, or FinancialDates + Occurrences, or all three together.</skos:changeNote>

Where multiple English names occur in 639-1 and 639-2, we have used the primary name specified in 639-2:1998 superseded by the latest revision posted by the registration authority, or, where multiples are specified by the registration authority, the reference name from ISO 639-3 as the &apos;named individual name&apos; for a given language. For languages specified in ISO 639-1, there is at least one English name and at least one French name for every language, corresponding to exactly one alpha-2 code.  Most languages from ISO 639-1 have at least one indigenous name.  Most languages with codes available from the Library of Congress also have at least one German name.  The correspondence between the alpha-2 codes and languages are made explicit in the individuals representing the codes themselves, and can be inferred for the languages using an OWL DL reasoner.

2.  This release of the ontology covers all languages specified in parts 1 and 2 of the standard, and categorizes the alpha-3 codes from part 2 according to the categorization scheme provided in parts 3 and 4.  Subsequent releases of the ontology will address additional languages covered in part 3, as well as additional components of the standard, such as equivalence to standards representing relevant scripts, as they become available, and the language groups covered by ISO 639-5.

3.  We have used individuals to represent all alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes, which, in turn, have matching strings (tags) associated with them for use in a variety of applications to facilitate reasoning and mapping.  The strings are provided as datatype properties of the individuals to support applications that may require them for RFC 4646-style tagging.
  
4.  Note that some tools, including certain UML tools, are case insensitive.  Thus, in cases where a language name collides with an alpha-2 or alpha-3 code, (i.e., Ga, Ewe, Fon, Ido, Lao, Tiv, Twi, Vai, and Yao), the names for the individual codes have been extended with &apos;_1&apos; (e.g., &apos;ewe_1&apos;).

5.  We found a few anomalies in the standards while developing this ontology.  These include: 
(1) Bihari is included in the 2002 version of 639-1, in the 1998 version of 639-2, and in the online codes posted by the Library of Congress in 2007 for parts 1 and 2, with part 1 code of &apos;bh&apos; and part 2 bibliographic and terminology codes of &apos;bih&apos;.  At that time, there was no discussion stating that Bihari is a collective language, although it was omitted from the downloadable data for 639-3.  Since then, the language element has been renamed &apos;Bihari languages&apos;, in both English and French, without change to the corresponding language codes.  The latest version of the code sets reflect this modification.  Our assumption is that the trigraph for Bihari is a collective language code, which is supported by online research in Eastern Indic languages.
(2) Serbo-Croatian was included in the 2002 version of 639-1, with part 1 code &apos;sh&apos;.  It was not mentioned in the 1998 version of 693-2, but appears in 639-3 with a language identifier of &apos;hbs&apos;, without codes for 639-2.  As of 2010, Serbo-Croation has been eliminated from ISO 639-1 and 639-2 codes altogether, and the ontology reflects this.
(3) Other changes in the latest version of the ontology include elimination of the 639-1 code for Moldavian, merging the language with Romanian, and additional English and French names for some languages, such as Dutch (to include Flemish, flamais), among others.
(4) German names for languages in ISO 639-2 were added to the Library of Congress in 2014, and are supported in this version of the ontology.

6.  The LCC 1.0 version of this ontology, published in advance of the 2017 New Orleans OMG Technical Meeting, was current as of 31 July 2017 with respect to the ISO 639-1 and 639-2 codes included herein.</skos:historyNote>

        <skos:editorialNote>This is not the balance of the debt at a point in time, but the amount drawn down at a specific point in time, after which (for interest bearing debts) interest becomes payable. Semantic Modeling note This term is over-ridden for specific kinds of debt (securities, loans) and is therefore not needed in any data model. It is included here to define part of the meaning of the Debt Finance term. It is a Relationship Fact and strictly speaking should be regarded as being specialized and over-ridden by the terms in the Loan and Security classes, however it is modeled here as a &quot;Referenceable Archetype&quot; meaning that it appears in diagrams as a textual entry not a relationship line, and so it is not possible to formally show this specialization.</skos:editorialNote>

        <skos:editorialNote>The domain for this property should be interpreted as being an abstraction which covers various forms of commitment, which may set out the existence of some notional amount of money, specified via this property.  This is left unspecified for now, so that the property can also be defined directly as being a property of some contractual term which describes that commitment.</skos:editorialNote>
        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>The notional amount (or notional principal amount or notional value) on a financial instrument is the nominal or face amount that is used to calculate payments made on that instrument. This amount generally does not change and is thus referred to as notional.
		
		For securities the nominal value is often referred to as the face or par value. This is the redemption price of the security and is normally stated on the front of that security. With respect to bonds and stocks, it is the stated value of an issued security, as opposed to its market value.
		
		When applied to a swap this is the amount used for calculating the actual value of the interest due. Also known as Notional Value when describing derivative contracts in the options, futures, and currency markets, this term is often used to value the underlying asset in a derivatives trade. It can be the total value of a position, how much value a position controls, or an agreed-upon amount in a contract.

		An example is that a firm might have a variable rate loan on $100,000 but decide to swap only $40,000. The $40,000 is the notional amount of the swap and becomes the amount on which interest is paid.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <skos:definition>A firm whose issued shares are all held by a family or a small group of investors and, therefore, cannot be bought by the public.</skos:definition>
        <skos:editorialNote>Wikipedia: definition for British or Commonwealth version: A private company limited by shares is a type of company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, Scotland, that of certain Commonwealth countries and the Republic of Ireland. It has shareholders with limited liability and its shares may not be offered to the general public, unlike those of public limited companies. Additional notes from Wikipedia: Limited by shares means that the company has shareholders, and that the liability of the shareholders to creditors of the company is limited to the capital originally invested, i.e. the nominal value of the shares and any premium paid in return for the issue of the shares by the company. A shareholders personal assets are thereby protected in the event of the companys insolvency, but money invested in the company will be lost. A limited company may be private or public. A private limited companys disclosure requirements are lighter, but for this reason its shares may not be offered to the general public (and therefore cannot be traded on a public stock exchange). This is the major distinguishing feature between a private limited company and a public limited company. Most companies, particularly small companies, are private. Private companies limited by shares are required to have the suffix Limited (often written Ltd or Ltd.) or Incorporated (Inc.) as part of their name, though the latter cannot be used in the UK or the Republic of Ireland. In the Republic of Ireland, Teoranta (Teo.) may be used instead, largely by Gaeltacht companies. Cyfyngedig (Cyf.) may be used by Welsh companies in a similar fashion.</skos:editorialNote>

        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>Merchant categories are organized by the type of business, trade or services supplied.  Certain category codes including those for very large businesses, such as airlines and some hotel chains, may be delineated to the point of identifying the business. Merchant category codes and/or the descriptions of the service categories are frequently used in credit card and other banking transactions for analysis, transaction classification, such as for use in promotional rewards, and sometimes tax-related purposes.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>Values are specified only for those merchant categories that are generally expected to originate retail financial transactions.  Criteria for establishing a new category code includes (a) the merchant category is reasonable and substantially different from all other merchant categories currently represented in the list of code values; (b) the merchant category is separate and distinct from all other industries currently represented in the list of code values; (c) the proposal describes a merchant category or industry, and not a process; (d) the minimum annual sales volume of merchants included in the merchant category, taken as a whole, is USD 10 million; and (e) sufficient justification for the addition of a new code value is found.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <skos:editorialNote>See SME REview note of 16 Jan 2013: Percentage mechanism (in contracts etc.) would be factored in. Hence percentages as contractual terms. For instance an option to exercise which would give another 5 percent control. So there is percentage control with or without share ownership. Example: In a partnership this might be in the Partnership Agreement, which would identify beneficial ownership and control as potentially 2 distinct things. Contract can say anything. Implications: This means that there are percentages of de jure control based in contract, similar to those based in constitutional instruments (shares, General Partner equity). The concepts of Parent, Siinificant Part Owner etc. can then potentially be defined int erms of the percentages of all applicable instruments by which control may be formally defined.</skos:editorialNote>

        <skos:definition>Some individual entity which is able to direct the affairs of some business organization to a specific degree.</skos:definition>
        <skos:editorialNote>The degree to which the party has control of (is able to direct the activities of) the organization in question is defined as a percentage value where one hundred percent would equate to control without the involvement of others. The percentage of control is a calculated, determined or asserted value, and not necessarily a percentage of some controlling interest, though in the absence of other factors the determination of percentage of control would equate to the percentage of controlling interest e.g. voting shares held.</skos:editorialNote>

        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>The legal power of a shareholder varies in proportion to their shareholding. Typically, ten percent and below stockholding provides no protection. Fifteen percent stockholding may give the power to petition courts against changing the shares class rights. Up to 49.9 percent stockholding normally gives power to demand calling of an extraordinary general meeting. Fifty percent and over stockholding gives power to fire a director and force out minority stockholders by acquiring their shares as per the rules of the firm. Holder of 75 percent of the stock has the power to change the articles and memorandum of association and the firms name, reduce the share capital, allow the firm to buy its own shares from other stockholders, and to shut down the business. One hundred percent stockholding of course gives total power under the corporate legislation.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <skos:definition>group of people comprising the governing body of an organization that has the authority to set organizational strategy and policies as well as to select and, to some degree manage, leadership</skos:definition>
        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>For a public, for profit organization, its members (directors) are elected normally by the subscribers (stockholders) of the firm (generally at an annual general meeting) to govern the firm and look after the subscribers&apos; interests. In the case of a not-for-profit organization, the board ensures the organization is acting in line with its mission. The board has the ultimate decision-making authority and, in general, is empowered to (1) set the company&apos;s policy, objectives, and overall direction, (2) adopt bylaws, (3) name members of the advisory, executive, finance, and other committees, (4) hire, monitor, evaluate, and fire the managing director and senior executives, (5) determine and pay the dividend, and (6) issue additional shares. Though all its members might not be engaged in the company&apos;s day-to-day operations, the entire board is held liable (under the doctrine of collective responsibility) for the consequences of the firm&apos;s policies, actions, and failures to act. Members of the board usually include senior-most executives (called inside directors or executive directors) as well as experts or respected persons chosen from the wider community (called outside directors or non-executive directors).</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>Day-count conventions apply to swaps, mortgages and forward rate agreements as well as bonds, each of which has its own day-count convention, which varies depending on the type of instrument, whether the interest rate is fixed or floating, and the country of issuance. Among the most common conventions are 30/360 or 365, actual/360 or 365, and actual/actual. A 30/360 convention assumes 30 days in a month and 360 days in a year. An actual/360 convention assumes the actual number of days in the given month and 360 days in the year. An actual/ actual convention uses the actual number of days in the given interest period and year.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>The index used to determine the specific interest rate is generally included in the terms of the loan. In most cases, lenders will also charge a spread, or added percentage points on top of the established index rate. If a loan is billed as prime plus 2.5 percent, for a prime rate of 3.5 percent, the terms of the loan will require the borrower to pay off a 6 percent interest. Floating interest rates typically involve periodic reset dates for the loan, particularly when the index rate changes. Resets may also occur online at market predetermined intervals, with yearly adjustments being a common arrangement.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <AnnotationVocabulary:adaptedFrom>Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended 12 August 2012</AnnotationVocabulary:adaptedFrom>
        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>A security can be any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap, bond, debenture,certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement or in any oil, gas, or other mineral royalty or lease, any collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or in general, any instrument commonly known as a security, or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing; but shall not include currency or any note, draft, bill of exchange, or bankers&apos; acceptance which has a maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months, exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which is likewise limited.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>In the U.S., the Supreme Court has adopted a flexible and liberal approach in determining what constitutes a security. In its famous decision of SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 90 L.Ed. 1244, 66 S.Ct. 1100 (1946), the Court held that land sales contracts for citrus groves in Florida, coupled with warranty deeds for the land and a contract to service the land, were &apos;investment contracts&apos; and thus securities. The Court stated that [a]n investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party. 66 S.Ct. at 1103. According to the Court, it is immaterial whether the shares in the enterprise are evidenced by formal certificates or by nominal interests in the physical assets employed in the enterprise. 66 S.Ct. at 1104.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>Some securities may be traded over the counter, or through an exchange, or via some other trading venue such as an electronic trading platform.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>Whether a contract or other economic right is a security essentially depends on whether the holder of the contract is acting as an investor who seeks financial benefits based on the work of a promoter or a third party.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <rdfs:label>standardized terms</rdfs:label>
        <skos:definition>a set of standardized terms, published by some body, and capable of being incorporated into a contract by agreement</skos:definition>
        <skos:editorialNote>The things that are standardized: The strike price Contract size Expiry Date These three are standardized regardless of what exchange they are on. Each exchange has a standard for these specific terms, for contracts that are traded on that exchange. Expiry: there is a standard date that the exchange will have, for example in the US it is the Saturday following the third Friday of every month. So there is a set expiration date for all exchange traded optons Strike: there are set increments for strike for exchange traded options. Contract sizes are also stipulated, for example in the US these are standardized by the OPRA Convention (Options Pricing Reporting Authority). Ajay: Exchange traded is tri party contract with central counterparty for the setelemtn fo the options. Market place (usually electronic), hence standard to process data. Not necessarily a legal difference? So for instance you would not be able to trade different lot sizes. So they enter in the contract which is guaranteed by the exchange. Members of the exchange trade with each other. The Exchange then being a third party. OTC: Bilateral Exchange traded: Still bilateral, using standardized terms. Lookalikes: for examples, where there are usually ones with monthly margin calls (exchange traded), there are &apos;lookalike&apos; ones which look like an ET but are traded outside the market. Common in commodities market. What else can be standardised? What must be standardidsed? Date Convention: Standardized by juridction US: All single-Equity Options are American; all European exercise for Indices. This is not a convention for say London, where various conventions may exist on different contracts.</skos:editorialNote>

        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is the standard used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S. business economy.

NAICS was developed under the auspices of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and adopted in 1997 to replace the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system. It was developed jointly by the U.S. Economic Classification Policy Committee (ECPC), Statistics Canada and Mexico&apos;s Instituto Nacional Estadistica y Geografia, to allow for a high level of comparability in business statistics among the North American countries.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>Standard Industrial Classifications are four-digit codes that categorize companies by the type of business activities they engage in. These codes were created by the U.S. government in 1937 to facilitate analysis of economic activity across government agencies and within industries. They were mostly replaced in 1997 by a new system of six-digit codes called the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The new codes were adopted in part to standardize industry data collection and analysis in between Canada, the United States and Mexico which had entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement.  Note that certain organizations, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) still use SIC codes for some purposes.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>These clearing houses are often operated by the major banks in the country. The house&apos;s prime responsibility is to provide efficiency and stability to the financial markets that they operate in.

There are two main processes that are carried out by CCPs: clearing and settlement of market transactions. Clearing relates to identifying the obligations of both parties on either side of a transaction. Settlement occurs when the final transfer of securities and funds occur.

CCPs benefit both parties in a transaction because they bear most of the credit risk. If two individuals deal with one another, the buyer bears the credit risk of the seller, and vice versa. When a CCP is used the credit risk that is held against both buyer and seller is coming from the CCP, which in all likelihood is much less than in the previous situation.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>An exchange is typically a corporation or mutual organization that provides securities trading services, where securities may be bought and sold by third parties. As a facility, an exchange is also a place of trade associated with a particular site, i.e., stock exchange, regulated market such as an Electronic Trading Platform (ECN), or unregulated market, such as an Automated Trading System (ATS) (MIC - ISO 10383). Stock exchanges also provide facilities for the issue and redemption of securities as well as other financial instruments and capital events including the payment of income and dividends.

The securities traded on a stock exchange include: shares issued by companies, unit trusts, derivatives, pooled investment products and bonds. To be able to trade a security on a certain stock exchange, it has to be listed there. Usually there is a central location at least for recordkeeping, but trade is less and less linked to such a physical place, as modern markets are electronic networks, which gives them advantages of speed and cost of transactions. Trade on an exchange is by members only.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>A basket may be associated with a specific market sector, and may be delineated for the purposes of statistical analysis, such as for calculating CPI. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), with respect to the CPI, a market basket is a package of goods and services that consumers purchase for day-to-day living. The weight of each item is based on the amount of expenditure reported by a sample of households.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>From a securities perspective, a basket is a collection of products or securities that are designated to mimic the performance of a market. For investors, the market basket is the principal idea behind index funds, which are essentially a broad sample of stocks, bonds or other securities in the market; this provides investors with a benchmark against which to compare their investment returns.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>The advent of money as a medium of exchange has allowed trade to be conducted in a manner that is much simpler and effective compared to earlier forms of trade, such as bartering. In financial markets, trading also can mean performing a transaction that involves the selling and purchasing of a security.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>The seller must deliver the commodity sold to the buyer; the buyer must pay the agreed purchase price, which could be in the form of other goods or services, on the agreed date.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>Trading activities typically include (a) regularly underwriting or dealing in securities; interest rate, foreign exchange rate, commodity, equity, and credit derivative contracts; other financial instruments; and other assets for resale, (b) acquiring or taking positions in such items principally for the purpose of selling in the near term or otherwise with the intent to resell in order to profit from short-term price movements, and (c) acquiring or taking positions in such items as an accommodation to customers or for other trading purposes.

        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>The first (left-most) two characters of the ISO 4217 3-letter currency identifier relate to the currency authority that issues the currency, and is, in most cases the ISO 3166-1 alpha 2 code for the geopolitical entity whose central bank is the issuer. The third (right-most) character of the identifier (alphabetic code) is an indicator derived from the name of the major currency unit or fund. If the currency is not associated with a single geographical entity as described in ISO 3166-1, typically a specially allocated identifier (alpha-2 code) is used to describe the currency authority. This code has been allocated by the Maintenance Agency from within the user-assigned range of codes XA to XZ specified in 8.1.3 of ISO 3166-1:2013. The character following X will be a mnemonic, where possible, derived from the name of the geographical area concerned.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <skos:definition>An agent is an autonomous individual that can adapt to and interact with its environment.</skos:definition>
        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>Agents, then, can be software agents, hardware agents, firmware agents, robotic agents, human agents, and so on.  While software developers naturally think of IT systems as being constructed of only software agents, a combination of agent mechanisms might in fact be used from shop-floor manufacturing to warfare systems.  The definition incorporated herein must be sufficiently general to account for these and other uses, such as for describing people and organizations who participate in broader processes and systems, for FIBO, other OMG standards and usage, and in general.

Whether or not you restrict your view of agents to the software variety, most agree that agents deployed for IT systems are not useful without the following three important properties:

(1) Autonomous - an agent is capable of acting without direct external intervention.  Agents have some degree of control over their internal state and can act based on their own experiences. They can also possess their own set of internal responsibilities and processing that enable them to act without any external choreography.  When an agent acts on behalf of (or as a proxy for) some person or thing, its autonomy is expected to embody the goals and policies of the entity that it represents.

(2) Interactive - an agent communicates with the environment and other agents. Agents are interactive entities because they are capable of exchanging rich forms of messages with other entities in their environment.  These messages can support requests for services and other kinds of resources, as well as event detection and notification.  They can be synchronous or asynchronous in nature.  The interaction can also be conversational in nature, such as negotiating contracts, marketplace-style bidding, or simply making a query.

(3) Adaptive - an agent is capable of responding to other agents and/or its environment. Agents can react to messages and events and then respond appropriately.  Agents can be designed to make difficult decisions and even modify their behavior based on their experiences.  They can learn and evolve.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>Note that this does not necessarily imply that an agent is free to act as it sees fit, without constraint. Rather, an autonomous thing in the sense meant here is something which may or may not be subject to controls and constraints but is self-actualizing in its behavior in response to any such constraints. Autonomous things may include human beings, organizations, software agents, robots and animals.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

Countries which do not have formal identity documents may require informal documents.  In the absence of a formal identity document, driving licenses can be used in many countries as a method of proof of identity, although some countries do not accept driving licenses for identification, often because in those countries they don&apos;t expire as documents and can be old and easily forged. Most countries accept passports as a form of identification.  Most countries have the rule that foreign citizens need to have their passport or occasionally a national identity card from their country available at any time if they do not have residence permit in the country.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>A national identification number, national identity number, or national insurance number is used by the governments of many countries as a means of tracking their citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents for the purposes of work, taxation, government benefits, health care, and other governmentally-related functions. The number will appear on an identity document issued by a country.

The ways in which such a system is implemented are dependent on the country, but in most cases, a citizen is issued an identification number at birth or when they reach a legal age (typically the age of 18). Non-citizens may be issued such numbers when they enter the country, or when granted a temporary or permanent residence permit.

Many countries issued such numbers ostensibly for a singular purpose, but over time, they become a de facto national identification number. For example, the United States originally developed its Social Security number system as a means of disbursing Social Security benefits. However, due to function creep, the number has become utilized for other purposes to the point where it is almost essential to have one to, among other things, open a bank account, obtain a credit card, or drive a car.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <skos:definition>contract in which only one party makes an express promise, or undertakes a performance without first securing a reciprocal agreement from the other party</skos:definition>
        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>In a unilateral, or one-sided, contract, one party, known as the offeror, makes a promise in exchange for an act (or abstention from acting) by another party, known as the offeree. If the offeree acts on the offeror&apos;s promise, the offeror is legally obligated to fulfill the contract, but an offeree cannot be forced to act (or not act), because no return promise has been made to the offeror. After an offeree has performed, only one enforceable promise exists, that of the offeror.

A unilateral contract differs from a Bilateral Contract, in which the parties exchange mutual promises. Bilateral contracts are commonly used in business transactions; a sale of goods is a type of bilateral contract.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <skos:editorialNote>The terms &apos;calendar xxx&apos; are intended to reinforce that these are periods on a calendar, not durations. 

For example, a calendar year always starts on a January 1 and ends on a December 31. The term &apos;calendar year&apos; does not mean the same thing as  a duration (an amount of time) of 1 year, nor can a calendar year start on any arbitrary day of a year.  For example, a calendar year never starts on September 1.

Similar points apply to other kinds of calendar periods, such as calendar week, calendar month, and calendar quarter.</skos:editorialNote>

        <rdfs:label>regular schedule</rdfs:label>
        <skos:definition>schedule whose time intervals recur regularly</skos:definition>
        <skos:editorialNote>The BusinessDates ontology extends &apos;RegularSchedule&apos; with an optional BusinessDayAdjustment that specifies what should happen if a scheduled date falls on a weekend or a holiday.</skos:editorialNote>
        <skos:example>A 30 year mortgage is payable monthly on the 10th of the month, starting July 2015. The mortgage is issued on June 15, 2015 so the first payment is for the period June 15-June 30, and the last payment is for June 1-14 2045.

The payment schedule is a RegularSchedule with these properties:

* comprises: regular payment OccurrenceKind (with payment details)  (see the &apos;comprises&apos; property of the Occurrences ontology)
* hasInitialStub: June 15-30, 2015 for initial payment
* hasFinalStub: June 1-14, 2045 for final payment
* hasCount: 358
* hasOverallPeriod starting Date: June 15, 2015 with a duration of 30 years
* hasRecurrenceInterval: specifies 10th day of each calendar month
* hasRecurrenceStartDate: July 1, 2015</skos:example>
        <skos:example>A corporate bond pays interest for 10 years starting on the first day of 2015.  Interest payments are due 15 days after the expiration of each 6 month period: on July 15 and January 16.

The payment schedule is a RegularSchedule, with these properties:

* comprises: identifies the interest payment details
* overall DatePeriod starting date is &apos;2015-01-01&apos;, ending date is &apos;2025-01-15&apos;, and duration is &apos;P10Y15D&apos;
* hasCount is 20 (2 payments per year for 10 years)
* hasRecurrenceInterval is &apos;P6M&apos;
* hasRecurrenceStartDate is &apos;2015-01-15&apos;</skos:example>
        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>A RegularSchedule is a Schedule defined as a set of Dates that start on a recurrence start date and repeat after each recurrence interval.  The size of this set is defined by a count.

The &apos;initial ScheduleStub&apos; associated with a RegularSchedule identifies any special treatment applied before the recurrence start date.  Similarly, a &apos;final ScheduleStub&apos; identifies any special handling at the end of the recurrences.  For example, a mortgage loan that is due each calendar month may have an initial payment due before the first calendar month, or a final payment due after the last monthly payment.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
        <AnnotationVocabulary:usageNote>Other ontologies can extend RegularSchedule as needed.

In particular, the Occurrences ontology extends RegularSchedule to &apos;comprise&apos; an &apos;OccurrenceKind&apos;.  The intended meaning is that a regular schedule comprises a number of scheduled dates and an event which is scheduled to occur on each of those dates, in other words an Occurrence of the OccurrenceKind should happen on each Date defined by the RegularSchedule.</AnnotationVocabulary:usageNote>
        <AnnotationVocabulary:usageNote>The recurrence start date can be an ExplicitDate or any kind of CalculatedDate.  Hence, the starting date could be relative to another Date (e.g. T+3) or triggered by the Occurrence of an OccurrenceKind, etc.

The recurrence start date can also be relative to the starting Date of the overall DatePeriod of the Schedule.</AnnotationVocabulary:usageNote>

        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>In the United States, statutes may also be called acts, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  Federal laws must be passed by both houses of Congress, the House of Representative and the Senate, and then usually require approval from the president before they can take effect.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>Statutes may originate with national, state legislatures or local municipalities. Statutory laws are subordinate to the higher constitutional laws of the land.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>Most constitutions seek to regulate the relationship between institutions of the state, in a basic sense the relationship between the executive, legislature and the judiciary, but also the relationship of institutions within those branches.  For example, executive branches can be divided into a head of government, government departments/ministries, executive agencies and a civil service/administration.  Most constitutions also attempt to define the relationship between individuals and the state, and to establish the broad rights of individual citizens. It is thus the most basic law of a territory from which all the other laws and rules are hierarchically derived; in some territories it is in fact called Basic Law.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>Law is a term which does not have a universally accepted definition. Certain laws are made by governments, specifically by their legislatures although the sense intended here is broader. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution (written or unwritten) and the rights encoded therein.  The law shapes politics, economics and society in countless ways and serves as a social mediator of relations between people.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <skos:scopeNote>The concept of a party in a role refers only to those contexts in which in natural English one would call someone a &apos;party&apos; for example being party to a contract or to a transaction; it does not cover entities as performing some role in some activity or process (the separate concept Actor covers that). A good test is whether the relative thing defined as PartyInRole can be sensibly said to have a part or play a part in something. Corresponds to the English (not data modeling) sense of the word &apos;Party&apos;.</skos:scopeNote>

        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>Electronic mail, abbreviated e-mail or email, is a method of composing, sending, and receiving messages over electronic communication systems.  The term e-mail applies both to the Internet e-mail system based on the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and to intranet systems allowing users within one company or organization to send messages to each other. Often these workgroup collaboration systems natively use non-standard protocols but have some form of gateway to allow them to send and receive Internet e-mail. Some organizations may use the Internet protocols for internal e-mail service.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>A Unit is a quantity in terms of which the magnitudes of other quantities that have the same quantity kind can be stated. A unit often relies on precise and reproducible ways to measure the unit. For example, a unit of length such as meter may be specified as a multiple of a particular wavelength of light. A unit may also specify less stable or precise ways to express some value, such as a cost expressed in some currency, or a severity rating measured by a numerical scale.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

For example, the quantity kind of length may be measured by units of meters, kilometers, or feet.  Note that this definition allows for dimensionless quantity kinds, such as rates.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
        <AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>Every instance of &apos;quantity kind&apos; is also a specialization of &apos;quantity&apos;. So the concept &apos;duration&apos; is an instance of &apos;quantity kind&apos; and it is a specialization of &apos;quantity&apos;, i.e., it is a classifier of actual quantities. But a given duration (i.e., the duration of something) is an instance of &apos;duration&apos; and thus a &apos;quantity value,&apos; not an instance of &apos;quantity kind&apos;. For example, a &apos;year&apos; is not an instance of quantity kind; it is an instance of quantity, but not a category of quantity.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

A geometric mean is often used when comparing different items - finding a single &apos;figure of merit&apos; for these items - when each item has multiple properties that have different numeric ranges. For example, the geometric mean can give a meaningful &apos;average&apos; to compare two companies which are each rated at 0 to 5 for their environmental sustainability, and are rated at 0 to 100 for their financial viability. If an arithmetic mean were used instead of a geometric mean, the financial viability is given more weight because its numeric range is larger - so a small percentage change in the financial rating (e.g. going from 80 to 90) makes a much larger difference in the arithmetic mean than a large percentage change in environmental sustainability (e.g. going from 2 to 5).</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
